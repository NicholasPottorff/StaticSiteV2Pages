I like to jump around from topic to topic like a ping pong ball and \"code along\" with what I learn. Well organized and structured web content is a godsend for me because my brain turns into mush whenever I see a wall of text. Redish, Kaufmann, and Bellamy really clicked for me because of the organization and the fact that paragraphs in their work are rarely very long. This allows me to jump from topic to topic very easily and helps my comprehension so much too. The Andersen piece was a slog for me to get through, and the way I see most content outlined these days I think many people would agree with me. Of course, not everything can be broken down into bite-size chunks for people with short attention spans, but it really doesn't hurt to try. My Egg tutorial was made with this in mind, and I do my utmost not to overwhelm the user with walls of text. You would be very surprised how many recipes have very long, unbroken paragraphs in them, and when I see these I usually try to find a different recipe. It may be just me, but I have less of an issue with a text wall when I'm reading on a physical piece of paper. Learning about how I work digitally Problem-solving is the bread and butter of working with any kind of digital workspace, be it an IDE, specialized editor, or the command line. I find it funny that my first reaction when I encounter the problem is to immediately google the error code or issue instead of checking the tutorial materials that you so graciously provide for us. Over the semester I got better at using the course materials to work through the issues I had in a methodical way. Solving a problem through StackOverflow or similar websites I've begun to think of as \"being given a fish\" because I just blindly try whatever solution without learning to think for myself. By working through code documentation and reference materials, you \"learn how to fish\" and develop problem solving skills.","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"#nick-pottorffs-digital-literacy-narrative-v2","text":"","title":"Nick Pottorff's Digital Literacy Narrative, V2"},{"location":"#learning-about-how-i-learn-digitally","text":"The way I learn presented me with a lot of challenges this semester.

During the Color Contrast Deep Dive LavaCon talk, the presenter brought up how poor color choice caused an airplane pilot to press the wrong button resulting in a fatal crash. During my first technical writing class with Dr. Gurak we also discussed how bad organization of information was a contributing factor to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Even something as seemingly harmless as a food recipe could result in getting someone sick if you aren't clear about risks of undercooked eggs for example. Headings, headings, headings Kaufmann's 11 guidelines for headings was probably my favorite page to read in this whole course. To me, these might as well be the 11 commandments from Kaufmann, the benevolent Goddess of Accessibility. It makes my blood boil when people write web content as if they have an ink or paper shortage. Headings help the reader by organizing the information in a way that they are able to pick and choose what they want or need to read. Headings also help me as a writer by providing me an outline and helping me plan out what I'm going to write. Some users might only be interested in certain types of egg dishes, and it is our job as content creators to guide them to their favorite egg dish as fast as we can. Make content for everybody Okay, obviously not everybody, but your content always needs to have concessions to make sure that there are no obstacles that might keep someone from using it properly. More and more games and websites these days have graphical filters for those experiencing color blindness, and adjustable text size for people with dyslexia or poor eyesight. I always try to keep my color palette very minimal, mostly sticking to black and white and one other color. People with trouble distinguishing colors usually don't have trouble with black and white, so this is a pretty safe way to go about color choice.","title":"Accessibility"},{"location":"access/#some-accessibility-and-usability-topics-that-stuck-with-me","text":"","title":"Some accessibility and usability topics that stuck with me"},{"location":"access/#bad-accessibility-kills","text":"We don't often think of how poor accessibility can have negative consequences.

In this guide, you'll master the art of boiling eggs. These egg tutorials are arranged in order of difficulty, from hard-boiled to deviled. Hard-Boiled Hard-Boiled eggs are easy to make and are a great snack that can be eaten at any time of day. They also stay edible for about 1 week, and you can cook many at once, making it a great option for meal-preppers. Ingredients eggs, chicken Recipe Put as many eggs as you want in your pot of choice, as long as the eggs form a single layer across the pot. Fill pot with water until the water is about 3 cm/1 in above the layer of eggs. Place the pot on your stove, and bring the heat to medium high. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Place a lid on the pot, and then turn off the heat. Let the eggs remain in the pot for 13 minutes with the lid on. Rinse eggs in cold water, and wait until they are cool to the touch. Peel and enjoy with salt, pepper, or a variety of other things! Soft-Boiled Soft-Boiled eggs are cooked in a similar way, but must be eaten very soon after cooking. Soft-Boiled eggs are used as parts of many Japanese and Korean noodle dishes or eaten by themselves. WARNING Soft boiled eggs may contain SALMONELLA, so eat at your own risk. Boiling for a longer time can reduce this risk, at the expense of a less liquid yolk. Ingredients eggs, chicken Recipe Put as many eggs as you want in your pot of choice, as long as the eggs form a single layer across the pot. Fill pot with water until the water is about 3 cm/1 in above the layer of eggs. Place the pot on your stove, and bring the heat to medium high. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Place a lid on the pot, and then turn off the heat. Let the eggs remain in the pot for 6 to 10 minutes with the lid on depending on your preferences. A 6 minute egg will have a liquid yolk and a soft white. A 10 minute egg will have a soft but more solid yolk and white. Rinse eggs in cold water or an ice bath, and serve immediately once shell cool to the touch. Deviled Eggs You've mastered the art of the hard boil and the soft boil. Now you're ready for the ultimate boiled egg challenge. A delicious hors d'oeuvres or appetizer, the deviled egg might be just what you need for your limited social gathering. Ingredients 6 eggs, chicken 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 teaspoon yellow mustard 1/8 teaspoon salt Ground black pepper (add to taste) Paprika (add to taste) Recipe Cook your 6 eggs according to the steps of the Hard Boiled section of the tutorial. Peel your eggs by first making a crack in the shell and run some cool water into the crack. The shell should slide right off. Dry the eggs lightly with a paper towel. Slice eggs in half vertically, and scoop out all of the yolks of the eggs into a bowl. Place empty egg whites on a different plate. Mash yolks until soft and add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Mix until it becomes a creamy, sauce-like mass. Scoop this sauce-like mass back into the empty egg whites. Try to keep the amount in each egg white consistent for aesthetic purposes. Sprinkle the top of the eggs with paprika and serve!","title":"Egg Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#how-to-boil-eggs-like-an-eggspert","text":"This tutorial was made with the accessibility principles I learned this year!
